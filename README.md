# Simulation Repository #

### Brief introduction ###

This repository will over time aim to accumulate code to simulate the behavior of ideas and drafts as proposed in 
certain groups within the IETF

Pull requests are always welcome - and in particular the hope is that we can build a repository of real running simulation
code that would not otherwise be available because some drafts are designed to be implemented on vendor hardware, and as
such "running code" often refers to whatever release of code for the device - rather than real source code that can be
analyzed and tested and played with.

Basically - this is an attempt to get back to running code - rather than running binaries.
